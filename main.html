<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

<p>
  Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. An algorithm is considered efficient if it has a low time complexity, meaning it can solve the problem quickly even for large inputs.
</p>

<p>
  Space Complexity is a measure of how much memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input. It is often denoted by O(n), where n represents the size of the input. In analyzing algorithms, we aim for algorithms with low space complexity to minimize memory usage. <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial, especially when dealing with large datasets or when memory is limited.
